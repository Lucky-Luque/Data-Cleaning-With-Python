# Data-Cleaning-With-Python

## Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

In this project, I will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

I will play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Analyzing NYC High School Data

For this project I used a dataset published by New York City containing student SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores by high school, along with additional demographic datasets.

The goal of the project is to determine if the SAT is a fair test. New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.

## Star Wars Survey

In order to determine what Star Wars movie is the preffered one by the general public, we will use a dataset collected by the team at FiveThirtyEight, in which they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonke and received 835 total responses.

Since there are several columns where the respondent had to check one or more boxes, we will need to first clean the dataset to perform the analysis.
